        <h1>4.10 Digital Anthology Presentation Final Product</h1>
        <h3>by Daniel Agapov</h3>

        <h2>My Anthology Synopsis</h2>
        <p>These are the three essays I've written to analyse each of these three texts:
            <ol>
                <li><a id="a1" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/genocide-murdered-missing-indigenous-women-inquiry-report-1.5157580"
                target="_blank"></a>National inquiry calls murders and disappearances of Indigenous women a 'Canadian genocide'
                Social Sharing - Jorge Barrera</li>
                <li><a id="a1" href=https://www.ted.com/talks/lindsay_morcom_a_history_of_indigenous_languages_and_how_to_revitalize_them"
                target="_blank"></a>A history of Indigenous languages â€” and how to revitalize them - Lindsay Morcom</li>
                <li><a id="a1" href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=0&v=EgaYz8YWsO8&feature=emb_title."
                target="_blank"></a>"Home To Me" - N'we Jinan Artists</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Overarching Theme</h2>
        <p>For our 4.5 virtual Classroom Meeting, we were asked to present our thematic statements to 
            connect the three essays together. After receiving feedback, I settled on this: "Providing 
            a new perspective for the public that differs from what the Canadian government has, to propel 
            reconciliation for Indigenous people". I didn't necessarily state this redundantly across 
            my essays, but did relate their importance back to this main theme in either the Introduction or 
            Conclusion paragraph of every essay. 

        <h2>Chosen Media Form</h2>
        <p>The reason why I chose to code this website, rather than make it from 
            Google Sites, is because of the experience I have with making similar ones. 
            I simply don't know how to make a good-looking website, other than by coding
            it. I'm not too comfortable with other platforms such as Google Sites, having 
            only used them for a couple projects. Whereas, I've coded about a dozen 
            websites similar to this one. This is how I felt I could present what I had 
            in as quick of a way I could. Also, it gave me the liberty to do certain things
            my way, rather than following a restricting template. Especially, since this assingment
            isn't too demanding in terms of how its presented technologically, I felt better about 
            doing this in the best way I know how.
